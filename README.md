LoanTap aims to strengthen its underwriting process for Personal Loans by leveraging data-driven decision-making. The goal is to analyze customer attributes and financial behavior to build a robust creditworthiness model that helps determine whether a credit line should be extended to an individual.

The analysis will focus on:

Identifying Key Predictors – Determining the most significant demographic, financial, and behavioral factors that influence loan approval decisions.

Creditworthiness Assessment – Developing a predictive framework to classify individuals as eligible or ineligible for a personal loan.

Risk Profiling – Segmenting applicants into low, medium, and high-risk categories based on repayment capability and default probability.

Business Recommendations – Suggesting optimal repayment terms (tenure, EMI flexibility, interest rates) tailored to each risk profile to minimize default risk while ensuring customer satisfaction.

Through this analysis, LoanTap can improve loan approval efficiency, reduce risk exposure, and enhance customer experience by offering customized repayment solutions for personal loans.
